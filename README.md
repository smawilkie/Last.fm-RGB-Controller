# Last.fm RGB Controller
A script to synchronise certain RGB enabled devices with album art from Last.fm

Hey! This is a personal project for my own setup, and is likely to need a little modification if you'd like to use it yourself.

The currently supported devices are:  
Razer Blackwidow TKL  
Razer Deathadder Chroma  
AMD Wraith Prism RGB (via Razer Chroma link)  
NZXT Smart Device (H500i case lights, will not work with CAM installed)  
Corsair Vengeance RGB (configured for 4 sticks by default)  

To use, create a .env file in the root directory as follows (quotations not required):  
API_KEY="a Last.fm API key"  
LASTFM_USERNAME="your Last.fm username"  
KEYBOARD_WIDTH="the number of keys across the width of your keyboard"  
KEYBOARD_HEIGHT="the number of keys along the height of your keyboard"
